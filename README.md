patch-tools
===========

Handy scripts to speed the development of patches.

brln
====

brln replaces a symbolic link with a copy of the linked file.

speediff
========

speediff moves 'orig-dir' to 'orig-dir.orig' and recursively walks the
directory and its subdirectories, reproducing the original hierarchy
and replacing regular files with symbolic links.
